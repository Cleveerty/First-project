**1. Importing Libraries**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from openpyxl import load_workbook
from fpdf import FPDF
import os
```

- **`import`**: This keyword is used to import modules or libraries into the Python script. These modules provide additional functionality.
- **`Flask`**: A lightweight web framework for Python used to build web applications. It allows you to create routes, handle HTTP requests, and serve web pages.
- **`request`**: A Flask object used to access incoming request data (e.g., form data, headers, etc.).
- **`send_file`**: A Flask function used to send files (e.g., PDFs, images, etc.) as HTTP responses.
- **`load_workbook`**: A function from the **openpyxl** library that is used to load and manipulate Excel files (`.xlsx`).
- **`FPDF`**: A class from the **fpdf** library used to generate PDF files programmatically.
- **`os`**: A built-in Python module used to interact with the operating system, such as handling file paths and directories.

---

### **2. Flask App Initialization**
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

- **`Flask(__name__)`**: Creates a Flask application instance. `__name__` is a built-in Python variable that refers to the name of the current module. Flask uses this to determine the root path of the application.
- **`app`**: This is the instance of the Flask application that will handle all routes and requests.

---

### **3. Route Definitions**
```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    ...
```

- **`@app.route('/')`**: This is a **decorator** in Flask that binds the `index()` function to the root URL (`/`). When someone visits the root URL, Flask calls the `index()` function.
- **`def index():`**: This is a function that will be executed when the route `/` is accessed. It defines the behavior of the route.

---

### **4. Serving HTML File**
```python
html_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'web.html')
with open(html_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    return f.read()
```

- **`os.path.join()`**: Joins one or more path components into a single path. It ensures compatibility across different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **`os.path.dirname(__file__)`**: Returns the directory of the current Python script file.
- **`with open(...)`**: Opens a file in a context manager, which ensures the file is properly closed after it's no longer needed.
- **`'r'`**: Opens the file in **read mode**.
- **`encoding='utf-8'`**: Specifies the character encoding to use when reading the file.
- **`f.read()`**: Reads the entire content of the file as a string and returns it.
- **`return f.read()`**: Sends the content of the `web.html` file as the HTTP response, effectively serving the HTML page.

---

### **5. Handling POST Requests**
```python
@app.route('/convert', methods=['POST'])
def convert():
    file_path = request.form.get('filePath')
    policy_number = request.form.get('policyNumber')
```

- **`methods=['POST']`**: Specifies that this route should only respond to **POST** HTTP requests.
- **`request.form.get()`**: Retrieves the value of a form field from the request. This is used to get the `filePath` and `policyNumber` from the submitted form data.

---

### **6. File Path Validation**
```python
if not file_path:
    return "File path not provided.", 400

if not os.path.isabs(file_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), file_path)

if not os.path.exists(file_path):
    return f"File not found: {file_path}", 400
```

- **`if not file_path`**: Checks if `file_path` is empty or `None`. If so, returns an error message with HTTP status code **400 (Bad Request)**.
- **`os.path.isabs(file_path)`**: Checks if the file path is **absolute** (starts from the root of the file system). If not, it converts it to an absolute path.
- **`os.path.exists(file_path)`**: Checks if the file exists at the specified path. If not, returns a **400 error** with the message.

---

### **7. Loading Excel File**
```python
wb = load_workbook(file_path)
ws = wb.active
```

- **`load_workbook(file_path)`**: Loads the Excel file into a workbook object (`wb`).
- **`wb.active`**: Gets the **active sheet** in the workbook (usually the first sheet).

---

### **8. Generating PDF**
```python
pdf = FPDF()
pdf.add_page()
pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
```

- **`FPDF()`**: Initializes a new PDF document.
- **`add_page()`**: Adds a new page to the PDF.
- **`set_font("Arial", size=12)`**: Sets the font to **Arial** with a font size of **12**.

---

### **9. Writing Excel Data to PDF**
```python
rows = list(ws.iter_rows(values_only=True))
for row in rows[1:]:
    row_text = "  ".join([str(cell) if cell is not None else "" for cell in row])
    pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=row_text, ln=1)
```

- **`iter_rows(values_only=True)`**: Iterates over all rows in the worksheet, returning only the **cell values** (not the cell objects).
- **`rows[1:]`**: Skips the first row (header row).
- **`str(cell) if cell is not None else ""`**: Converts each cell to a string, or an empty string if the cell is `None`.
- **`"  ".join(...)`**: Joins the cells in a row with two spaces between them.
- **`pdf.cell(200, 10, txt=row_text, ln=1)`**:
  - `200`: Width of the cell (in units).
  - `10`: Height of the cell.
  - `txt=row_text`: Text to be added to the cell.
  - `ln=1`: Moves the cursor to the next line after the cell.

---

### **10. Saving and Returning PDF**
```python
output_pdf = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), f"{policy_number}.pdf")
pdf.output(output_pdf)

return send_file(output_pdf, as_attachment=True, download_name=f"{policy_number}.pdf")
```

- **`os.path.join(...)`**: Creates the absolute path where the PDF will be saved.
- **`pdf.output(output_pdf)`**: Saves the generated PDF to the specified file path.
- **`send_file(...)`**: Sends the PDF file to the client.
- **`as_attachment=True`**: Tells the browser to download the file instead of displaying it.
- **`download_name`**: Specifies the name of the file when it's downloaded.

---

### **11. Running the Flask App**
```python
if __name__
